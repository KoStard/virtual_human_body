- Register owners in the NeuralPaths +
- Dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_column–medial_lemniscus_pathway
- Add divisions when some neural path is leaving the group - can be used for selective stimulation 
- Add receptors!
- Maybe - add length, neuron types, speed and timings
- Add multiple names for elements - tract of Burdach...
- Add timeline - bind tasks to the timeline point and run them in that order - simulating parallel processes
- Maybe - add fillInto method -> add all elements to the target group
- Multiple sources and targets for neural pathways - stimulation of any source will trigger every target
- Return vector of stimulated elements when calling stimulate
- Automatically handle owners/children - this is a problem
- Use generics in the base classes - getElements...
