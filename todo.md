- Add divisions when some neural path is leaving the group - can be used for selective stimulation 
- Add receptors!
- Maybe - add length, neuron types, speed and timings
- Add multiple names for elements - tract of Burdach...
- Add timeline - bind tasks to the timeline point and run them in that order - simulating parallel processes
