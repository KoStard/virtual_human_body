Four spinocerebellar tracts
- ventral/rostral - proprioception from joints, tendons and ligaments - lower/upper body
- dorsal/cuneocerebellar - proprioception from muscle, joints, tendons and ligaments - lower/upper body

From:
skeletal muscle - muscle spindles
tendons and ligaments - Golgi tendon organs
joints - fibrous capsules

Tests:
- touch your nose with your finger

Dorsal:
- mainly transmits muscle spindle signals
- of the lower body - T6 and below

Rostral:
- 

Ventral:
- from joints, tendons and ligaments
